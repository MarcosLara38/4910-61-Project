A picture is worth a thousand words :).\nWhen rolling, if the butter feels too stiff, let the dough rest on the counter for a while (otherwise, the stiff butter will break up into big chunks and pierce through the layers). If the butter starts to melt, put the dough back in the fridge for 30 minutes (otherwise, the melted butter will stick the layers together, or leak from the dough.
